## Project Description
The purpose of this Software Development Plan is to outline the structure, features, 
and operational requirements of the Library Management System (LMS). This system is 
designed to provide a simple, console-based solution for managing patrons, books, and 
transactions such as check-ins, checkouts, and fine tracking. By defining requirements, 
constraints, implementation strategies, and testing approaches, this plan ensures that 
development proceeds in a clear and organized manner.

The system is intended to be lightweight and accessible, relying on console 
interactions rather than graphical interfaces or database integrations. This keeps the focus 
on core functionality such as patron management, book tracking, and enforcing library 
policies like overdue fines and checkout limits.

This plan also documents how the system will be implemented step by step, how 
risks and constraints will be addressed, and how testing will validate functionality. 
Together, these elements form a complete roadmap for building a reliable, maintainable 
system that meets user expectations while adhering to project constraints.
